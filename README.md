# Rosalind-Challenges
The Rosalind Challenges are computational problems pertaining to bioinformatics.

Information about the problems can be found on http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/

Language used: Python 3

Notable problems:

 	25_Genome Assembly as Shortest Superstring.py
  
Due to the colossal amount of test data to process, the problem above forces the use of dynamic programming to complete in a reasonable timeframe.
